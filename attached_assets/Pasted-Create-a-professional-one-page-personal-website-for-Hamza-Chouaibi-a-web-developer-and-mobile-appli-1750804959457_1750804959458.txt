Create a professional one-page personal website for Hamza Chouaibi, a web developer and mobile application developer. The website should be built using React and TypeScript with a focus on clean design, animations, and responsiveness. The website should follow a dark theme for the overall design, ensuring that the content remains legible and visually appealing.

Wireframe Layout:
Header (Top Navigation Bar)

Logo/Name: Display "Hamza Chouaibi" prominently at the top.

Navigation Links: Smooth scrolling links to the sections: About, Skills, Projects, Contact.

Sticky Navigation: The navbar should stick to the top when scrolling.

Animation: Navigation items should have a hover animation (e.g., scale or underline effect).

Hero Section

Background: A professional background image or a clean gradient with darker tones (to match the dark theme).

Text Animation: The text "Hi, my name is Hamza Chouaibi" should appear one letter at a time, simulating a typing effect.

The typing effect should use a cursor-like line (|) that blinks next to the text, as if itâ€™s moving with the typing.

Animation Speed: Customize the typing speed using JavaScript/React state to simulate the typewriter effect, with a blinking cursor styled using CSS animations.

Subheading: "Web & Mobile App Developer."

Button: "View My Work" that scrolls to the Projects section.

Animation: Fade-in effect for the text, with slight movement on hover for the button.

About Section

Title: "About Me"

Content: Create a beautiful and engaging about section with a clean design and smooth animations. This should introduce yourself, your background, and your professional goals.

Image: A professional headshot or abstract image, designed to fit well with the dark theme.

Animations: As the user scrolls to this section, the content should fade in with a smooth sliding effect from the left or right. The text can appear first, followed by the image.

Style: Use soft, subtle animations like fading or sliding to create a professional and polished feel. You can animate elements like the introduction text, your image, and any key details in this section.

Skills Section

Title: "Skills"

Additional Features:
Dark Theme: Use a dark color palette (e.g., dark grays, blacks, and subtle accent colors like blue or green) to give the website a sleek, professional look.

Responsive Design: Ensure the website is fully responsive, especially for mobile devices.
